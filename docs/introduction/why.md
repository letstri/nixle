# Why Nixle?

## Headache

When starting a new project, it's important to have a clear understanding of how to design a proper architecture and where to place logic and routes. Unfortunately, many frameworks don't make it easy to create well-structured applications with minimal code. This can lead to frustration and inefficiencies during development.

Looking ahead to the future, it's also crucial to integrate with SSR frameworks like Nuxt and Next. Both frameworks already have a server built-in, but it can be challenging to integrate them with existing frameworks.

## Solution

That's where **Nixle** comes in. It's designed to solve these problems by providing a simple and intuitive way to create well-structured applications with minimal code. Nixle builds on top of popular frameworks like Fastify, Express, Elysia, Hono, and Nitro, giving developers a consistent and familiar experience.

One of the great things about Nixle is that it's built with **TypeScript**, which brings many benefits like type safety and code completion. This makes it easier to write code and reduces the number of bugs in your application.

## SSR Compatibility

Future-proof your projects by integrating with SSR frameworks like [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com). Say goodbye to separate frontend and backend applications and instead build a single application that can be deployed anywhere. With Nixle, you can seamlessly incorporate SSR capabilities, opening up new possibilities for improved performance and user experience.
