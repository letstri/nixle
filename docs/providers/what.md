# Providers

When making HTTP requests, we leverage existing frameworks to avoid common mistakes and take advantage of their main functionality, such as `path` and `query` parameters.

To prevent repetitive code duplication across different frameworks, we have developed a set of providers. These providers help minimize the amount of copy-pasted code and promote code reusability.
